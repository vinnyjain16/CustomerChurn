# CustomerChurn
This Streamlit-based web app predicts customer churn using machine learning. Users can upload custom data, use sample data, or connect to a database. The system performs data validation, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations like histograms and heatmaps. It applies classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM, using train_test_split for model training and testing. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are displayed to assess model performance. Interactive dashboards help users identify churn patterns and gain actionable insightsâ€”all in an intuitive interface built with Python and Streamlit.
